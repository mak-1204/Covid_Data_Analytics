# COVID-19 Global Trends Analysis (SQL & Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores global COVID-19 data using **SQL** to uncover trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations. Advanced SQL techniques were applied to derive key insights and structure data for visualization in **Tableau**, enabling better storytelling through data-driven dashboards.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze COVID-19 data to understand global and country-level trends.
* Derive key metrics such as **death rate, infection rate, and vaccination coverage**.
* Practice and demonstrate proficiency in **SQL query optimization and data analysis**.
* Prepare clean datasets for **visualization and KPI generation** in Tableau.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **SQL** (MySQL / PostgreSQL) – Data exploration and analysis
* **Tableau** – Dashboard design and visualization
* **Excel** – Data preprocessing and validation

## 🔍 Key Highlights

* Utilized **Joins, CTEs, Window Functions, Temp Tables, and Aggregate Functions** for analysis.
* Extracted insights on **global cases, deaths, and vaccination progress**.
* Built datasets optimized for Tableau dashboards.
* Developed KPIs for storytelling and decision-making.

## 📊 Sample Insights

* Calculated **death percentage and infection rates** per country.
* Identified top countries by vaccination coverage and infection spread.
* Visualized pandemic trends across continents with Tableau dashboards.

## 🚀 Outcomes

* Strengthened SQL skills in **data wrangling, query optimization, and KPI generation**.
* Built an end-to-end workflow: from raw data → SQL exploration → structured datasets → Tableau visualization.
* Produced actionable insights on COVID-19 trends useful for business and policy perspectives.
